This is NOT a general-purpose image reader, I'm including code thats hopefully easy to follow and can be 
incorporated into game textures/backgrounds/sprites. The file readers are compatible with files exported
by Adobe Illustrator and some are included in the \res folder.

Supports Windows only for now
